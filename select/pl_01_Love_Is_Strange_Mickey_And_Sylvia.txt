Love, love is strange
Lot of people take it for a game
Once you get it
You never wanna quit, no no
After you've had it, yeah yeah
You're in an awful fix
Many people
Don't understand, no no
They think loving, yeah yeah
Is money in the hand
Your sweet loving
Is better than a kiss, yeah yeah
When you leave me
Sweet kisses I miss
(Silvia...)
Yes Mickey?
(How do you call your loverboy?)
Come 'ere loverboy!
(And if he doesnt answer?)
Oh, loverboy!
(And if he STILL doesnt answer?)
I simply say
Baby
Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
Baby
Ohh baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
